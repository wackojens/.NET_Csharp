Wrong table name: dbo.Macthup_Entries => dbo.Matchup_Entries (or even better imo: dbo.MatchupEntries)

Wrong column name in dbo.Teams: Name => TeamName

No TournamentId column in dbo.Matchups + TournamentId = FK

WinnerId in dbo.Matchups should be nullable

Refrain from using underscore in Table and column names (personal pref + keep it same as video and program)

score column in dbo.Macthup_Entries: int => float and score => Score

TeamCompeting in dbo.Macthup_Entries should be nullable

15/03:
dbo.Macthup_Entries: ParentMatchup should be nullable

dbo.People: Email => EmailAdress

dbo.Macthup_Entries: Score should be nullable

dbo.Tournaments: add new column => Active
